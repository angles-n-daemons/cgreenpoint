some of the previous tests have broken

seems as if a few things aren't working quite right

- precedence parsing (tests which expect 11 get 7 or vice versa)
- variable assignment (getting an error for referencing a variable in it's own declaration)

so much of this project has been pulling apart at the seams.

I think it would have done a lot more to have setup some guards for myself upfront.

There's a feeling of inadaquacy which might not be totally unwarranted. I feel as if someone else could somewhat easily resolve these issues which keep hindering progress. One step forward and a mountain of mistakes to clean up. It's much like demolition despite not trying to demolish anything. I'm trying to build. I can spend about 30 minutes right now on each issue, it's not a bad way to spend my time.

Okay so it seems like it's found the right bit

Now I just need to figure out why this is happening

What a joy a little bit of patience can be. I found the issue with local variable resolution, and I fixed the numeric error becaus the expected output of the test was wrong. Now to get back to jumping.

I think to some degree I understand what's happening with and_, though there's something that seems to still escape me.

I forget how parse precedence works I suppose, and that leaves the big parsePrecedence function after in confusion to me

Separately I don't even know where parsePrecedence is

What does patch jump do again?

Seems like and is pretty high on the precedence hierarchy
