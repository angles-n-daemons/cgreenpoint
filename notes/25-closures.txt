did a little work setting up testing for greenpoint files

I also setup some syntax highlighting using kotlin as it has a similar syntax


So it seems as if some of the discussion on this seems to describe closures not working on the stack

Why wouldn't they though, if you could possibly keep the right values on the stack wouldn't they appropriately close over the values?

Why do we need our own object type? why not identify closed variables and keep them on the stack? Is that what we're going to do?
